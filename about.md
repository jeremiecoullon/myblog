<img src="/assets/Jeremie_crop_opt.jpg" class="about_image image-left"/>  <p class="about_bio">Hi, I'm Jeremie and I live in London. I'm doing a postdoc at Lancaster University with <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/~nemeth/">Chris Nemeth</a> in scalable Bayesian inference. I recently finished my PhD in computational statistics at UCL with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/yvopokern">Yvo Pokern</a>.

I play gypsy jazz, write code, and like computational stats & machine learning.</p>

Tech stack I tend to use:

- *Science:* Python/Numpy, JAX, Julia, S3, EC2
- *Web development:* Django, React, Heroku, S3, Netlify, EC2
