<img src="/assets/Jeremie_crop_opt.jpg" class="about_image image-left"/>  <p class="about_bio">Hi, I'm Jeremie and I live in London. I'm at statistical scientist at <a href="https://cervest.earth/">Cervest</a> working on climate modelling. Before that I did a postdoc at Lancaster University with <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/~nemeth/">Chris Nemeth</a> in scalable Bayesian inference, and a PhD in computational statistics at UCL with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/yvopokern">Yvo Pokern</a>.

I play gypsy jazz, write code, and like computational stats & machine learning.</p>

**Research:**
- Efficient and Generalizable Tuning Strategies for Stochastic Gradient MCMCerv [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13059)
- Ensemble sampler for infinite-dimensional inverse problems. [[Statistics and Computing, 2021]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-021-10004-y) [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15181)
- MCMC for a hyperbolic Bayesian inverse problem in traffic flow modelling [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02013)
- [PhD thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10078714/)


**Software I wrote / contibuted to:**

- [SGMCMCJax](https://github.com/jeremiecoullon/SGMCMCJax): lightweight library of stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms written in JAX
- [The DjangoVerse](https://www.londondjangocollective.com/djangoverse/): interactive data visualisation of Gypsy Jazz musicians around the world


**Tech stack I tend to use:**

- *Science:* Python/Numpy, JAX, Julia, S3, EC2
- *Web development:* Django, React, Heroku, S3, Netlify, EC2

**Music related projects:**
- [Latchepen](https://www.latchepen.com/): Gypsy jazz quartet
- [London Django Collective](https://londondjangocollective.com): Collective of a few gypsy jazz players in London. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olV9ecNxin8) of one of my tunes.
- [Gypsy Jazz memes](https://www.instagram.com/gypsyjazzmemes/)

**Other projects:**
- [Knowitwall](https://knowitwall.com): public engagement magazine based at UCL
- [The Art of Toastie](https://www.instagram.com/jeremie.coullon/)

**Meet:**

I'm always happy to chat about science/tech/maths/random! So if you're in London and want to meet for coffee/tea just email me at `jeremie.coullon at gmail.com`. I'll buy the drinks :)
