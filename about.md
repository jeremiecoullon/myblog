<img src="/assets/Jeremie_crop_opt.jpg" class="about_image image-left"/>  <p class="about_bio">Hi, I'm Jeremie and I live in London. I'm doing a postdoc at Lancaster University with <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/~nemeth/">Chris Nemeth</a> in scalable Bayesian inference. I did PhD in computational statistics at UCL with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/yvopokern">Yvo Pokern</a>.

I play gypsy jazz, write code, and like computational stats & machine learning.</p>

**Tech stack I tend to use:**

- *Science:* Python/Numpy, JAX, Julia, S3, EC2
- *Web development:* Django, React, Heroku, S3, Netlify, EC2



**Music related projects:**

**Meet:**

I'm always happy to chat about science/tech/maths/random! So if you're in London and want to meet for coffee/tea just email me at `jeremie.coullon at gmail.com`. I'll buy the drinks :)
